I am a soon-to-be graduate (end of 2024) from the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) with a Master's degree in Communications and Signal Processing. My academic journey began at [Southwest University](http://www.swu.edu.cn/), where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr.Fumie Costen](https://github.com/maxine111111111) from [School of Engineering](https://www.se.manchester.ac.uk)
